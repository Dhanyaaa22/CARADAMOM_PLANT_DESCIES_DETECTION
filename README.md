# CARADAMOM_PLANT_DESCIES_DETECTION
Developed a cardamom plant disease detection system using machine learning techniques. Implemented image processing algorithms to identify and classify plant diseases, improving early detection and management. This project enhanced predictive accuracy and provided actionable insights for better crop health and yield.

The Cardamom Plant Disease Detection project was designed to identify and classify diseases in cardamom plants through machine learning. Using the VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN), the project aimed to train a model to recognize patterns in images of plant leaves that indicate the presence of diseases such as leaf spots, blight, or mold, alongside healthy leaves.

To begin, a dataset of labeled images was collected, featuring various cardamom plant diseases as well as healthy leaves. These images were then preprocessed to ensure consistency in size and quality. Techniques like data augmentation were applied to create a more diverse dataset for training the model. The VGG19 model, which is known for its depth and effectiveness in extracting detailed features from images, was then fine-tuned on this specific dataset to detect diseases in cardamom plants.

After training, the modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using testing images, and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall were used to assess its effectiveness. Once satisfactory results were achieved, the model was ready to be deployed in an application where farmers could upload images of their plants to receive disease predictions. This system provided an automated way to detect plant diseases early, allowing farmers to take preventive action and improve crop health.
